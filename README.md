# Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the given number is **even** or **odd** using `if...else` statements.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Get an input from the user.
2. Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable `a`.
3. Use the modulo operator `%` to check if `a % 2 == 0`.
   - If true, print `"EVEN"`.
   - Else, print `"ODD"`.
4. End the program.

## 🧾 Program
```
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{num} is even.")
else:
    print(f"{num} is odd.")

```

## Result

Thus, the python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements is exceuted successfully.



# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False`.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Set variable `a` to the result of the expression `0 == True`.
2. Set variable `b` to the result of the expression `False == False`.
3. Set variable `c` to the result of the expression `True + True`.
4. Set variable `d` to the result of the expression `False + 9`.
5. Print the value of `a` with the label "a is".
6. Print the value of `b` with the label "b is".
7. Print the value of `c` with the label "c:".
8. Print the value of `d` with the label "d:".

## 💻 Program

```
a = (False == True)

b = (False== 0)

c = False + True

d = False + 5
print(f"a is {a}")
print(f"b is {b}")
print(f"c: {c}")
print(f"d: {d}")
```

## Output

## Result
Thus, the Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False` is executed successfully.



# Datatypes-Character Literal in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters `'T'` and `'a'` using character literals.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Print the character `'T'`.
2. Print the character `'a'`.

## 🧾 Program

```
v='T'
b='a'
print(v)
print(b)
```
## Output

<img width="368" height="171" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/060d64f9-bdd2-4abd-8b32-60cdd3abca4d" />


## Result

Thus, the Python program that prints the characters `'T'` and `'a'` using character literals is executed successfully.



# 🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

## 💻 Program

```
x=int(input(''))
y=int(input(''))
x=complex(x,y)
print(x)
print(x.real)
print(x.imag)
```

## Output

<img width="388" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d77e0b70-eca5-4c7c-8d3f-ddcde274dda1" />


## Result

Thus, the Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts is executed successfully.



# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## 🧾 Program

```
men_stepped_on_the_moon = input()
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)

```

## Output

<img width="386" height="172" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02c33e09-6211-4b76-b0e1-fbcc1de2a9b7" />


## Result

Thus, the Python program to read a string from the user and then print it is exceuted successfully.
